# LSTM-Baseline-Code-Sentiment-Analysis

This is the baseline code for the AIML428 course. It analyses the sentiment based on a dataset of reviews in IMDB.

This code can be run by selecting the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the .ipynb file of this repository when opened in Github (https://github.com/walwi878/LSTM-Baseline-Code-Sentiment-Analysis). In Google Colab, under the Runtime tab, select "Run all".
